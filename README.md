I like the cvxopt package written by M. Andersen, J. Dahl, and L. Vandenberghe.
https://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt

You need to install this package before you continue with cvxFin. However, cvxOpt is often part
Python distributions.

cvxFin illustrates how cvxopt can be used to solve problems arising in quantitative finance.

I provide a setup.py and requirements.txt. I don't have much experience with the actual deployment of Python libraries.
Please provide feedback.

I have created some tests. They are available by running nosetests. Again let me know how you manage.

To install this package type
python setup.py install
