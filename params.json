Vandenberghe.\r\nhttps://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt\r\n\r\nYou need to install this package before you continue with cvxFin. However, cvxOpt is often part\r\nPython distributions.\r\n\r\ncvxFin illustrates how cvxopt can be used to solve problems arising in quantitative finance.\r\n\r\nI provide a setup.py and requirements.txt. I don't have much experience with the actual deployment of Python libraries.\r\nPlease provide feedback.\r\n\r\nI have created some tests. They are available by running nosetests. Again let me know how you manage.\r\n\r\nTo install this package type\r\npython setup.py install\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
